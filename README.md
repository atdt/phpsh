phpsh
-----

**phpsh** is an interactive interpreter for PHP <= 5.3, built in Python. It was
released by Facebook in 2008 and then abandoned. This repository is an
unofficial fork, created for the purpose of collecting small fixes on top of
release 1.3, the final release from Facebook.

If you're not an existing user, **stop**. There are better options out there. I
recommend [Boris](https://github.com/d11wtq/boris).

I do not intend to develop phpsh further or triage bugs, but I will happily
review and merge pull requests that fix bugs or make focussed, practical
improvements to the code.
